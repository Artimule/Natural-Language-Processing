# Principal Component Analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised statistical technique algorithm. PCA is a “dimensionality reduction” method. It reduces the number of variables that are correlated to each other into fewer independent variables without losing the essence of these variables. It provides an overview of linear relationships between inputs and variables.

# When to use PCA?
Whenever we want to ensure that variables in data are independent to each other.
When we want to reduce the number of variables in a data set with many variables in it.
When we want to interpret data and variable selection out of it.

# Why Scaling ?
It is necessary to scale data before performing PCA. The PCA calculates a new projection of your data set. If you scale your data, all variables have the same standard deviation, thus all variables have the same weight and your PCA calculates relevant axis

# What are dimensionality reduction and its benefits?

The Dimensionality reduction refers to the process of converting a data set with vast dimensions into data with fewer dimensions (fields) to convey similar information concisely. 
This reduction helps in compressing data and reducing storage space. It also reduces computation time as fewer dimensions lead to less computing. It removes redundant features; for example, there's no point in storing a value in two different units (meters and inches).
